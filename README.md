# TIP

*Tips Dataset
A popular dataset for practicing EDA, statistics, and data visualization.

* Overview
The Tips Dataset contains restaurant bill and tipping information collected from customers. It is commonly used in data science to learn Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, EDA, and statistical analysis.
This dataset helps analyze how different factors—such as bill amount, gender, smoking status, group size, and time of day—influence tipping behavior.

*Dataset Description
Columns
total_bill: Total bill amount
tip: Tip amount
sex: Gender of customer (Male/Female)
smoker: Whether customer is a smoker (Yes/No)
day: Day of week (Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun)
time: Meal time (Lunch/Dinner)
size: Number of people dining

*Use Cases
This dataset is ideal for:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation analysis
Regression modeling
Hypothesis testing
Data visualization practice
Teaching Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

*Example Insights
You can explore:
Relationship between total_bill and tip
Tipping patterns across days
Whether smokers tip differently
How group size affects tipping
Gender differences in tipping
Lunch vs dinner bill comparison

*Tools & Libraries
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Power BI

*License
This dataset is intended for educational, learning, and analysis purposes only.
